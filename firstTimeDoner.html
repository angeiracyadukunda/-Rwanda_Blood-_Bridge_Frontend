           <p>Thank you for choosing to donate blood! As a first-time donor, you might have some questions. This page will guide you through the process and help you prepare for a successful donation.</p>
        <div id="why-give-blood">

            <h3>Why Give Blood</h3>
            <p>Blood donation is an essential and altruistic act that saves lives and supports
                 medical treatments. In emergencies, surgeries, and for patients with chronic illnesses 
                 or rare blood types, donated blood can be the difference between life and death. 
                 It also provides critical support for new mothers and babies facing childbirth complications.
                  Beyond its medical benefits, blood donation brings communities together and offers health benefits to donors,
                   such as regular health checks. Donating blood is a simple yet powerful way to fulfill a moral duty,
                    showing that a small act of generosity can have a profound impact on the lives of others.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="what-to-expect">
            <h3>What to Expect</h3>
            <p>The blood donation process is designed to be safe and comfortable for all donors.
                 When you arrive at the donation center, you'll start by checking in and providing
                  a form of identification. You'll then complete a health questionnaire to ensure
                   that you're eligible to donate. A healthcare professional will conduct a brief physical examination, 
                   checking your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and hemoglobin levels to ensure you are healthy enough to donate. 
                   Once cleared, you'll be seated comfortably, and a sterile needle will be inserted into your arm to begin the donation. 
                   The actual blood collection takes about 10 minutes, during which you'll be asked to relax. After donating,
                    you'll rest briefly and enjoy refreshments to help your body recover. The entire process is simple, safe,
                     and typically takes about an hour, allowing you to make a significant impact by helping those in need.</p>

        <div id="can-i-give-blood">
            <h3>Can I Give Blood</h3>
            <p>Details on eligibility criteria for blood donation...</p>
            <p>To ensure the safety of both donors and recipients, there are specific eligibility criteria for blood donation.
                 Generally, donors must be between 16 and 65 years old, weigh at least 110 pounds (50 kg), and be in good health. 
                 They must have a regular pulse, a healthy blood pressure, and adequate hemoglobin levels. Recent travel to high-risk areas,
                  certain medications, and specific medical conditions may temporarily or permanently disqualify individuals. 
                  Lifestyle factors like recent tattoos, piercings, or substance use can also affect eligibility. Women who are pregnant, 
                  breastfeeding, or recently had surgery may need to wait before donating. These criteria help maintain a safe and reliable blood supply.</p>

            <h3>How to Get Ready</h3>
            <p>Guidelines on how to prepare for donating blood...</p>
            <h2>1. Stay Hydrated</h2>
            <p>Drink plenty of water the day before and on the day of your donation. Staying hydrated helps maintain your blood volume and makes it easier to access your veins.</p>

            <h2>2. Eat a Healthy Meal</h2>
            <p>Eat a balanced meal 3-4 hours before donating. Focus on foods rich in iron, such as lean meats, beans, spinach, and fortified cereals. Avoid fatty foods, as they can affect blood testing.</p>

            <h2>3. Get a Good Night’s Sleep</h2>
            <p>Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep the night before your donation. Being well-rested helps your body recover quickly and keeps you feeling well during and after donation.</p>

            <h2>4. Wear Comfortable Clothing</h2>
            <p>Wear a short-sleeved shirt or one with sleeves that can easily be rolled up. This makes it easier for the healthcare professional to access your arm.</p>

            <h2>5. Bring Identification</h2>
            <p>Bring a form of identification, such as a driver's license or donor card. You’ll need to show this during the registration process at the donation center.</p>

            <h2>6. Know Your Medical History</h2>
            <p>Be prepared to answer questions about your medical history, medications, and lifestyle habits. Answer honestly to ensure your safety and the safety of the blood recipients.</p>
